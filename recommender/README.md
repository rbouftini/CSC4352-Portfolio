## Similarity Computation Using Jaccard Similarity and Min Hashing
# Project Overview
This project focuses on computing similarity between entities using Jaccard Similarity and its approximation through Min Hashing. The project demonstrates the application of these techniques in analyzing user preferences for films, providing a foundation for building recommendation systems.
# Key Features
Exact Jaccard Similarity: Computes the exact similarity between films based on the overlap of user preferences.
Min Hash Approximation: Implements Min Hashing to efficiently approximate Jaccard Similarity, enabling scalability for large datasets.
Recommendation System: Uses the similarity scores to recommend films that are most similar to a user's favorite films.
Visualization: Visualizes similarity matrices to provide insights into relationships between films.
